Hi there 👋

I'm Brandon N Nkawu, a developer from Johannesburg, South Africa. I love programming both as a job and as a hobby and spend a lot of time writing code and testing new ideas. I work mainly with web technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, NextJS, ReactJS, TypeScript, Tailwind, and mono-repositories. I occasionally dabble in Python.
